#Code for HW3
'''
Todos:
1.  Define a function named CountNucs that takes two arguments, a string s and a character c, and returns the number of times c occurs in s
2. Create a int list of length 7 named Counts
3. Use CountNucs to count the number of nucleotides in string [A,C,G,T,N,Y,U]
4. Set Count[i] to the number of times the ith nucleotide in [A,C,G,T,N,Y,U] occurs in each sequence (Counts[1] should be the number of C’s in the sequence)
5. Print the following:
Sequence: *s*
*n* occurs *i* times for each nucleotide n
The sequence has *n* nucleotides where *a* (*p* percent) are ambiguous (n is length of string and a is the number of ambiguity codes, and p is $a/n$
A blank line between outputs

Sequence 1: CGCAGCTAACGCATTAAGCACTCCGCCTGGGGAGTACGACCGCAAGGTTGAA
Sequence 2: CGCATCGTAAAGCTCTGTTGTTGGTGAAGAAGGATAGAGGTAGTAACTGGCCT

Notes:
Print can take multiple arguments separated by commas
Follow style guidelines in section 4.8 of online tutorial
