1. Make file a standalone executable using a shebang with the appropriate modifications
#!/usr/bin/env python3 #This should be the first line of your code and should make it work

2. File needs to take two parameters at run time, the first being an input file and the second being an output file
Get user input:
	while True:
		filename = input("Enter input file name: "P
		try: 
			with open(filename, "r") as f: processFile(f)
			break
		except IO error as err: 
			print("Invalid file!", err)
		finally: print("Input accepted!"
Get user output file:
	

3. Run code from HW4
4. Pass output from HW4 code into a dictionary
See lecture 9/29

5. Add sequences to another dictionary using sampleID as a key
6. Also add GC content to the end of each entry in the first dictionary
7. Write the following to the runtime output file
a. # Input file *inputFileName*
b. # Output file *outputFileName*
c. # Sequences processed: *numberOfSequences*
d. # Average sequence length: *averageLength*
e. # Average GC Content: *averageGC*
8. Run program with sequences.fasta as input and seqDataOutput.txt as output
