These are the responses to the within homework questions for homework 8.

4) The correlation between the Shannon and Simpson diversity indexes is 0.95297. This 
	suggests a high degree of correlation between these variables suggesting that either
	can be used as a proxy for microbial community diversity.

5) None of the variables tested have a particularly high correlation. Score has a correlation
	of 0.4681 which could suggest some degree of positive correlation. It is possible that this is
	suggesting that there is a positive interaction between the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and
	the Shannon diversity index.
	
6) Again, none of the correlations are particularly high. L. crispatus, A. vaginae, Megasphaera, and Prevotella
	have correlations between 0.3 and 0.4 with Score. Some are negative and some are positive. These correlations
	might suggest that the OTU relative abundances have either a positive or negative interaction (depends on sign 
	of correlation) with the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. L. gasseri has the only correlation that might bear
	some significance with MEDS. The positive 0.3451 correlation might suggest that the use of medications increases
	the OSU relative abundance of L. gasseri.
